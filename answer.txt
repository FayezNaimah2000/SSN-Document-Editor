The reason why the speed is better in project 3 than in project 2 is because 
project 3 has a much simpler data structure. Project 3 has a linked list which is easy to 
insert and delete points of data anywhere on it whereas project 2 had arrays which hard to increase to 
insert and delete points of data as the rest of the data had to shifted. Also, you have
to constantly resize the array to appropriatly hold the number of entries whereas you
dont have to resize the linked list
